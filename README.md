# Linux Kernel Development Repository

Welcome to the Linux Kernel Development Repository!

## About
This repository is dedicated to kernel development for the Linux operating system. Whether you're an experienced kernel developer or just starting, this is the place to collaborate, experiment, and contribute to the Linux kernel.


### Linux kernel

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
